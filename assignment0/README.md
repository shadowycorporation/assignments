## Intro

This is a guide to get you set up to work for Shadowy Corporation, Inc.
It is the first step before you can begin to be productive for
Shadow Corp., and therefore it pays nothing. However, without this, you
might as well forget your dreams of making the big bucks as a hacker.

## Setup

Assignments can be completed in your language of choice; however,
Shadowy Corp. recommends Python, a powerful language used by hackers
worldwide.

### Install Python

[Download and install Python from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Make sure you use the latest version of Python 3.6.x.

### Install PyCharm

PyCharm is a powerful editor for writing Python code.
[Download and install the free community edition from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

### PyCharm tutorial

Go through [this tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/step-1-creating-and-running-your-first-python-project.html)
to make sure your PyCharm is setup and running.
At the end, ensure that you are able to:
- start a new Python project
- write and edit code
- run the code
- stop the running code

### Github Gist tutorial

Go to [Github](https://github.com) and create a new account. You will use
Github to submit your assignments. In particular, you will use "gists" to
paste and save your code.
[Go here to create a gist](https://gist.github.com/).
Give the gist a name, such as `assignment0.py` (note: the `.py` extension
indicates that this is a Python code file).
Now write or paste some code, and then click
`Create public gist`. To submit your assignment to
Shadowy Corporation, Inc, simply copy the gist link once it's saved, and
paste it into the submission email.

## Assignment

If you have reached here, that means the above set up went well, and you
have done the following things:

- You installed Python
- You installed PyCharm
- You are able to create new Python projects and run them
- You created a Github account
- You are able to create Github gists

That's great. Shadowy Corporation, Inc, admires resourceful hackers. To
prove that you have done all those things, please fullfil the following
assignment and submit your code:

The following code sums all of the numbers from 1 to 100:
```python
sum = 0
n = 1
while n <= 100:
    sum = sum + n
    n = n + 1

print(sum)
```

Please modify this code to sum all of the numbers from 553 to 7961812.
Once your code is finished, please put it into a gist, and email the gist
url *along with the sum* to Shadowy Corporation Inc. Good luck.
